<s> SUMMARYThe stratum corneum  is in fact mainly responsible for the difference of behaviour between the clear skin and the dark skin and this for the following reasons:First, the reflection of energy is higher for the clear skin due to its   higher index of refraction n. Second, the conductivity is also higher for the clear skin especially in the near ultraviolet and visible spectra.  </s>
