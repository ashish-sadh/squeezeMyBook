Deeply sorry, says Tiger Woods 
PONTE VEDRA BEACH (Florida): Golf icon Tiger Woods apologised for having affairs and said on Friday he was unsure when he would return to competitive golf.

"I was unfaithful. I had affairs. I cheated. What I did was not acceptable,” said Woods, looking composed and speaking in a steady voice. His wife, Elin, was not obviously present.

As for going back to the U.S. PGA Tour, Woods said: “I do plan to return to golf one day. I just don't know when that day will be. I don't rule out it will be this year.

Woods talked for more than 13 minutes from the clubhouse at the TPC Sawgrass, home of the U.S. PGA Tour. About 40 people were in the room, including his mother. He hugged her when he finished speaking.

“I am deeply sorry for my irresponsible and selfish behaviour,” Woods said.

Admitting he felt he “deserved to enjoy the temptations” that came with his fabulous success, Woods said he was solely responsible for his actions. Woods said he was in treatment for 45 days and would return for more therapy, adding he had more work to do to resolve his personal problems. The world’s No. 1 golfer had not talked in public since his traffic accident on November 27 triggered shocking revelations about Woods’ serial infidelity.
