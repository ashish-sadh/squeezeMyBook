<s> Yellow Nile
The Yellow Nile is a former tributary that connected the Ouaddai Highlands of Eastern Chad to the Nile River Valley c. 8000 to c. 1000 BCE.  </s>
<s> Its remains are known as the Wadi Howar.  </s>
<s> The wadi passes through Gharb Darfur near the northern border with Chad and meets up with the Nile near the southern point of the Great Bend.  </s>
<s> Lost headwaters
Formerly Lake Tanganyika drained northwards along the African Rift Valley into the Albert Nile, making the Nile about 900 miles (1,400 km) longer, until blocked in Miocene times by the bulk of the Virunga Volcanoes. .  </s>

The Nile (iteru in Ancient Egyptian) has been the lifeline of civilization in Egypt since the Stone Age, with most of the population and all of the cities of Egypt resting along those parts of the Nile valley lying north of Aswan.  </s>
<s> Climate change at the end of the most recent ice age led to the formation of the Sahara desert, possibly as long ago as 3400 BC.  </s>
<s> The Eonile
The present Nile is at least the fifth river that has flowed north from the Ethiopian Highlands.  </s>
<s> Satellite imagery was used to identify dry watercourses in the desert to the west of the Nile.  </s>
<s> An Eonile canyon, now filled by surface drift, represents an ancestral Nile called the Eonile that flowed during the later Miocene(23
5.  3 million years before present).  </s>
<s> The Eonile transported clastic sediments to the Mediterranean; several natural gas fields have been discovered within these sediments.  </s>
<s> During the late-Miocene Messinian salinity crisis, when the Mediterranean Sea was a closed basin and evaporated to the point of being empty or nearly so, the Nile cut its course down to the new base level until it was several hundred feet below world ocean level at Aswan and 8,000 feet (2,400 m) below Cairo.  </s>
<s> This created a very long and deep canyon which was filled with sediment when the Mediterranean was recreated.  </s>
<s> At some point the sediments raised the riverbed sufficiently for the river to overflow westward into a depression to create Lake Moeris.  </s>
<s> Lake Tanganyika drained northwards into the Nile until the Virunga Volcanoes blocked its course in Rwanda.  </s>
<s> The Nile was much longer at that time, with its furthest headwaters in northern Zambia.  </s>
<s> The integrated Nile
There are two theories about the age of the integrated Nile.  </s>
<s> One is that the integrated drainage of the Nile is of young age, and that the Nile basin was formerly broken into series of separate basins, only the most northerly of which fed a river following the present course of the Nile in Egypt and Sudan.  </s>
<s> Said postulated that Egypt itself supplied most of the waters of the Nile during the early part of its history.  </s>
<s> The other theory is that the drainage from Ethiopia via rivers equivalent to the Blue Nile and the Atbara andTakazze flowed to the Mediterranean via the Egyptian Nile since well back into Tertiary times.  </s>
<s> Salama suggested that during the Tertiary (65 million to 2.  588 million years ago) a series of separate closed continental basins each occupied one of the major parts of the Sudanese Rift System: Mellut Rift, White Nile Rift, Blue Nile Rift, Atbara Rift and Sag El Naam Rift.  </s>
<s> The Mellut Rift Basin is nearly 12 kilometers (7 mi) deep at its central part.  </s>
<s> This rift is possibly still active, with reported tectonic activity in its northern and southern boundaries.  </s>
<s> The Sudd swamps which form the central part of the basin may still be subsiding.  </s>
<s> The White Nile Rift System, although shallower than Bahr al-Arab, is about 9 kilometers (6 mi) deep.  </s>
<s> Geophysical exploration of the Blue Nile Rift System estimated the depth of the sediments to be 5
9 kilometres (3.  1
5.  6 mi).  </s>
<s> These basins were not interconnected until their subsidence ceased, and the rate of sediment deposition was enough to fill and connect them.  </s>
<s> The Egyptian Nile connected to the Sudanese Nile, which captures the Ethiopian and Equatorial headwaters during the current stages of tectonic activity in the Eastern, Central and Sudanese Rift Systems.  </s>
<s> The connection of the different Niles occurred during cyclic wet periods.  </s>
<s> The River Atbara overflowed its closed basin during the wet periods that occurred about 100,000 to 120,000 years ago.  </s>
<s> The Blue Nile connected to the main Nile during the 70,000
80,000 years B. P. wet period.  </s>
<s> The White Nile system in Bahr El Arab and White Nile Rifts remained a closed lake until the connection of the Victoria Nile to the main system some 12,500 years ago.  </s>
