Jesus of Nazareth (c. 5 BC/BCE – c. 30 AD/CE),[3] also known as Jesus Christ, is the central figure of Christianity, which views him as the Messiah foretold in the Old Testament, with most Christian denominations believing him to be the Son of God [6] who was raised from the dead.[7] Islam considers Jesus a prophet and also the Messiah.[8] Several other religions revere him in some way. He is one of the most influential figures in human history.

The principal sources of information regarding Jesus' life and teachings are the four canonical gospels, especially the Synoptic Gospels,[9][10] though some scholars argue such texts as the Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of the Hebrews [11][12] are also relevant.[13]

Most critical scholars in biblical studies believe that some parts of the New Testament are useful for reconstructing Jesus' life,[14][15][16][17] agreeing that Jesus was a Jew who was regarded as a teacher and healer, that he was baptized by John the Baptist, and was crucified in Jerusalem on the orders of the Roman Prefect of Judaea, Pontius Pilate, on the charge of sedition against the Roman Empire.[18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29] Aside from these few conclusions, academic debate continues regarding the chronology, the central message of Jesus' preaching, his social class, cultural environment, and religious orientation.[13] Scholars offer competing descriptions of Jesus as the awaited Messiah,[30] as a self-described Messiah, as the leader of an apocalyptic movement, as an itinerant sage, as a charismatic healer, and as the founder of an independent religious movement.

Christians predominantly believe that Jesus is the "Son of God" (generally meaning that he is God the Son, the second person in the Trinity) who came to provide salvation and reconciliation with God by his death for their sins.[31]:568-603 Other Christian beliefs include Jesus' virgin birth,[31]:529-532 performance of miracles,[31]:358-359 ascension into Heaven,[31]:616-620 and a future Second Coming.[31]:1091-1109 While the doctrine of the Trinity is accepted by most Christians, a few groups reject the doctrine of the Trinity, wholly or partly, as non-scriptural.[32]

In Islam, Jesus (Arabic: عيسى‎, commonly transliterated as Isa) is considered one of God's important prophets,[33][34] a bringer of scripture, and a worker of miracles. Jesus is also called "Messiah", but Islam does not teach that he was divine. Islam teaches that Jesus ascended bodily to heaven without experiencing the crucifixion and resurrection,[35] rather than the traditional Christian belief of the death and resurrection of Jesus.
