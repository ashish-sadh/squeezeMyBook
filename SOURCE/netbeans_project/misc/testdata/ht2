NEW DELHI: A Delhi court today granted bail to two Britons detained here for allegedly recording the conversation between pilots and Air Traffic Control.

Metropolitan magistrate Saurabh Pratap Singh Laler allowed the bail plea of Stephen Hampston (46) and Steve Martin (55) on furnishing of a personal and a surety bond of Rs 10,000 each.

The court, which fixed the matter for further hearing on March 2, asked the accused Britishers not to leave the country without the permission of the court.

The Delhi police did not oppose the bail bid of the accused, who have been booked under the Indian Telegraph Act for allegedly recording the conversation between pilots and Air Traffic Control.

A case under Telegraph Act under Section 20 (read with Section four) was registered against them yesterday. The offence comes under bailable and non-cognizable offences.

According to Section 20 of Telegraph Act, if any person establishes, maintains or works a telegraph within the country in contravention of the provisions of Section 4 which allows only licenced ones to establish, maintain or work a telegraph, be it on ships and aircraft, it is a punishable offence.

The Britons, who are employed with Railways in UK, were confined to Radisson Hotel near the international airport here on February 15 after hotel staff reported to police that they were indulging in "suspicious activities".
