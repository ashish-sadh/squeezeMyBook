- Requirement:
   You need python to execute this software. If your machine doesn't have it, check http://www.python.org/ .
   
- Usage:
python multiOrderEval.py target_order_file_to_evaluate multiple_standard_order_file [option] 
example: python multiOrderEval.py example/systemOrder.txt example/humanOrders.txt 0
	option = 0: FreSPA (default) Frequent Sequential Pattern-based Aggregation
			Known to be the best among methods proposed in the paper
			Parameters for FreSPA is preset based on the experiments.
			You can change 'parameter' section at the top of the code.
		1: WCA Weighted Correlation Aggregation with Kendall's tau
		2: WCA Weighted Correlation Aggregation with Spearman's rank correlation
		3: RBA Rank-based Aggregation with Kendall's tau with Kendall's tau
		4: RBA Rank-based Aggregation with Kendall's tau with Spearman's rank correlation

- Input file format
   The 'target_order_file_to_evaluate' should have only one order to evaluate, and 'multiple_standard_order_file' have multiple gold standard orders to compare. If there is multiple orders in 'target_order_file_to_evaluate', only the first line is used to evaluate.
   Each line of file is one order, which starts with index of order (any indicator), and a list of symbols of items. Each items are separated by space. You can use any types of symbols without space. The sample symbols should be used in both input files.
   For example, look up files in the example folder.
